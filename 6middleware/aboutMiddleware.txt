->Middleware is basically name for any code that runs(on the server) between the getting a req and sending a response. 
->So, when a request is sent from the browser, any code that runs before sending a response is a middleware code. We can see it visually in the middleware.png file.
->We generally use .use method (app.use(func)) as our middleware code, and we have seen that before in our 404 responses.
->There can we multiple middleware functions that runs on the server, as shown in middleware2.png
