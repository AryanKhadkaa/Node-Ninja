A view engine is a tool or library in web dev that helps generate HTMPL pages dynamically.
It is mainly used in SSR(Server Side Rendering) to combine template files with data and profuce HTML at the server 
and send it to the browser all-ready, the content is rendered at server not on the frontend, the final HTML is viewed in the frontend sent by the server.

In Node js, view engines are used to generate dynamic HTML content by rendering templates.
View engines allows us to embed variables, loops etv within HTML to create dynamic pages.

These engines allow you to pass data from your server-side code (like Express) into templates and render HTML dynamically.
For example, with Express, you set a view engine using app.set('view engine', 'ejs') and use res.render('template', data) to render a view.

Here, "template" is the html file and "data" is the data from the client/frontend or any other specified data passed to the html to use and render it dynamically.

With view engines, you donâ€™t need to build HTML content from scratch every time.
They help reduce the amount of redundant code and allow reusable components or partial views.

Some popular view engines are : EJS(Embedded JS) , pug , handlebars

// Here, we learn about EJS, as it is easy and very useful


Also, client-side rendering frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have somewhat reduced the need for view engines in single-page applications (SPAs).
 These frameworks manage dynamic content on the client-side, and they don't rely on server-side view engines to render HTML. Instead, they send JSON data to the frontend, and the frontend dynamically builds and updates the UI.
